# ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING WITH C AND C++

--------------------------------------------------------
## This repository contains solution to the```PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES``` Course Questions 


-----------------------------------------------------------
```
1.Take an example C program in which main function calls any other function with 3 or more
call by value parameters. Find out how and when values of actual parameters are passed to the
formal parameters in the called function. Also point out when and where main function (or any
other function) copies return address to the called function. Note: refer chapter 9 and 10 of the
book

2. Repeat question 1 first in C (using pointers) and later in C++ (by using reference variable) by
making one of the parameters as pass by reference. Observe the change in the assembly version.

3. How C/C++ compilers handle fixed stack dynamic and stack dynamic arrays?

4. Create more than one heap dynamic variables in C/C++ and observe the difference in addresses
of different heap dynamic variables and also compare them with static and stack dynamic
variables.

5. On page number 359 of book Concepts of programming languages 10th edition, Prof. Sebesta
has discussed three different strategies to implement a switch statement depending on the range
of case constants. Find out which method is used by C/C++ in implementing switch statement.
Try using different range of case constants to observe if the compiler selects different strategy
depending on range of case constants.

6. Comment on how C/C++ compiler uses stack to implement a recursive program. Whether it
uses the method described in the text book on page numbers 351 âˆ’ 353?
